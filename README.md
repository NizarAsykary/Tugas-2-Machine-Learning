About datasets:
- Classification
  This is a set of data created for rice classification. I recommend using this dataset for educational purposes, for practice and to acquire the necessary knowledge. All attributes are numeric variables and they are listed bellow:
  - id
  - Area
  - MajorAxisLength
  - MinorAxisLength
  -Eccentricity
  - ConvexArea
  - EquivDiameter
  - Extent
  - Perimeter
  - Roundness
  - AspectRation
  - Class

- Regression
  The dataset we have here provides a treasure trove of information about video game sales, spanning multiple years and different regions and platforms. With data on the number of units sold, revenue generated, and other key metrics, the dataset can help answer burning questions such as: What are the top-selling video games of all time? How do video game sales vary by region?
